	<p class="plot">
		30 years have passed. Luke has disappeared. Han and Leia have split up. He's reverted to his old ways and gone to seed as a freighter captain still holding a grudge, mourning his failed marriage and, most important, missing his first love, the Millennium Falcon. Leia remains a big wig with the rebels - who are now called The Resistence. Meanwhile, there's a new evil group in the galaxy far far away called The First Order. Kylo Ren, one of the leader of First Order but who also is a son of Han and Leia, is a Darth Vader fanboy bent on destroying what's left of the Republic. Rey, who slowly begins to feel the Force inside her and uses it to help locate the missing Skywalker, who handled Han and Leia's son's Jedi training so badly that he became Kylo Ren. Han helps the Resistence destroy The First Order's planet-munching machine, but dies in the effort. And Rey finally meets Luke.
