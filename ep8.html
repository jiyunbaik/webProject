	<p class="plot">
		Rey tries to convince Luke to return to Leia and possibly save the universe. The problem is, after the failure that has become Kylo Ren, he has disconnected from the force and simply waits for his time to die. Meanwhile, Leia, Finn, Poe, and the rest are learning the first orders newest technology makes it so going light speed no longer means a quick escape. Leading to base after base having to be abandoned and Finn, alongside a new friend, possible love interest, Rose doing what Poe finds himself unable to do. They broke into the battleship and nearly disabled the dreaded tracker, they get captured. Then, to make matters worse, DJ, their code breaker, he sells them and what is left of the rebel forces, who are trying to escape, out. But, despite that, there is consistently hope. Vice Admiral Holdo, the remaining person on the rebel's major ship, goes light speed through the battleship and rips it in half. Meanwhile, Rey breaks through to Luke and gets him to at least give her one lesson, shows her where the books of Jedi history are, which she saves from Luke's planned destruction of them, and she also breaks through to Kylo Ren. Well, at least long enough for him to kill Supreme Leader Snoke. However, what Rey thought might have been a glimpse of the light was truly just part of the dark side. For with the death of Supreme Leader Snoke, now Kylo can create his own destiny. One he wished Rey to join since they grew close, but she rejects. So, he continues on, solo, and finds himself being what Vader never did become - supreme leader. Though, with Kylo still a very emotional person, he is unable to keep the rebel forces from escaping his grasp. Luke, channeling himself from the island, after Yoda reminds him of his purpose, distracts Kylo long enough for Leia and Chewbacca, with the Millennium Falcon, to rescue all that remains of the Resistance.
